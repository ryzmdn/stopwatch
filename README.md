# Stopwatch

The Stopwatch is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive and visually appealing way to measure elapsed time. The application employs a **queue algorithm** to manage and process user actions efficiently.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Timer**: Start and stop the timer with ease using intuitive controls.
- **Lap Functionality**: Record multiple lap times during a single session.
- **Clear Timer**: Reset the stopwatch to start a new session.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Implements a queue algorithm to ensure accurate processing of start, stop, and lap actions.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with buttons to start, stop, record laps, and reset the stopwatch.

2. **Queue Algorithm**: User actions such as "Start," "Stop," and "Lap" are processed in sequence using a queue algorithm to ensure precise timing and proper state management.

3. **Dynamic Updates**: JavaScript dynamically updates the timer display in real-time, and lap times are appended to the DOM as the user records them.

4. **Styling with CSS**: CSS enhances the user interface, providing a clean, modern, and visually appealing design.
